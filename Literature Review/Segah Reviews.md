1. According to the authors, the work focuses on association rule mining and decision making for  
closed-ended hierarchical questionnaire data.Throughout it, the approach is not clear when we focus on the mentioned goal.  
Very important concepts and foundations concerning questionnaires are addressed, however, the link between theory and practice seems to be not clear.  
Thus, it is very confusing to identify the scope of the mentioned goal, as well as the direct association with the proposed title.


2. It is not clear to me what is the research question that the paper aims to answer. The content of the manuscript seems rather a research plan of an interesting project that is in progress. Yet, the methodology section contains a vague description of the proposed model. At the same time, the Results section is missing.  
  
Section II (Literature Review) describes how were the papers collected. Here the authors demonstrate a rigorous process to select a group of papers. However, I would expect a more detailed analysis of the data of those papers. This analysis should be conducted using the methodology described in Section III. Yet, I fail to understand the how the method proposed in Section III was used to analyse the data described in Section II.  
  
Additionally, it is confusing that the last step in the methodology section is about communicating the results of the research project. I would expect to see in this section a description of the proposed method for analysing closed-ended questions, rather than a description of the plan for the research project.
