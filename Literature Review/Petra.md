#### How to write one

The crucial difference between the more general overview paper and the more critical review paper is central to the issue of added value (Table 1): an overview paper does not need to add value, but review paper does.

In terms of the added value, an LRP needs to have a clear message and interpretation, and this should indeed be a central part of the rationale for writing the paper in the first place. Perhaps it is best to take a problem that can be specified as a series of objectives, and then to structure the review around these. This type of review is very much evidence-based and is similar to a conventional paper. Alternatively, there is also the potential to use a more heuristic approach and leave the objectives more open-ended. This might provide a more appealing approach, but it means that the clear conclusions need to be drawn at the end. In both cases, the interpretation of the material used is central to a high-quality LRP, and a paper with weak or no conclusions must be avoided. Some of these issues are now discussed in more detail.

A classic LRP would first outline the structure and purpose of the review, and it would then present the literature in a logical way, commenting on the differences and similarities between the materials cited, and this would then be followed by discussion and conclusions — it is this last part that relates to the added value of the LRP.

Often snowballing is used, and this should be made explicit. Forward snowballing implies finding citations to a paper, whereas backward snowballing implies finding citations in a paper (Jalali & Wohlin, [2012](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01441647.2015.1065456#)). Even if the selection of papers to be included in the review is based on more subjective criteria, such as personal knowledge, extensive research in an area, brainstorming with experts, and other open-ended approaches, there is a methodological section that needs to be written on the process by which papers have been selected, together with comment and reflection on the strengths and weaknesses.

In most cases it is helpful that the abstract of an LRP not only describes the paper but also includes the main conclusions and added value.

The main reasons for rejection are not difficult to summarise. The key element is whether the paper is really a review or more of an overview, and here the key element is the added value. It should be written in an authoritative and constructively critical narrative. Another reason for rejection is that its aims are not met. The paper should clearly state its objectives in the introduction, and the conclusion should return to these objectives to assess whether they have been achieved. A third reason for rejection is that the paper has not been fully developed, as it is really an early draft. This means that the structure is weak, the evidence is partial, and there is no real content or thought in the LRP.
