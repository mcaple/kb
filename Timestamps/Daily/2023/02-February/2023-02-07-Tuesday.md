# Outcomes

## Today I Completed
- Format complete but one of the coloured figures for ROC was left out because the tinker library not suitable with acmart

## Today I Made Progress on
-  Methodology section: Changed this to Design Science Research and added a Research Framework subsection.
- Conclusion: Changed this to be relevant to only this paper. Previously I mentioned how the data was synthetic and how we would use live data in the future. Now I state the conclusions of the work this paper deals with.

## Today I Started
-  Thinking about an alternate title that is not simply my thesis title. Obviously if my thesis references this it should have the same name as the thesis. At the moment thinking about "Gaining Classification Insights from Closed-Ended Medical Questionnaires".
