Watched a video about Obsidian
- Used top 10 Obsidian plugins from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7kTtn9empU)
- Started beginners Obsidian from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUrOfIqvGS4)
- [This](https://youtu.be/D7e1ud_Dk24?t=464) mentions turning your notes into a slide presentation
- Syncing your [vault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3oK1yX3CZ8) with GitHub
- Should you keep [one or more vaults](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV3PHeyCHvc)

Have decided that I will try to keep a single kb vault for all specific knowledge and then as we create projects for architecture discussions etc, we can link to the knowledge base (kb) vault

Picked up new laptop today from Auburn (Tom). He gave me a free slimline docking station
