#### Shutter speed and movement

Shutters are a mechanical  system for controlling the time during which light is allowed to reach the light sensitive material in the camera.

3 types of shutters

- The digital or CCD shutter - electronically limits the sampling time of the sensor
- The leaf shutter or iris shutter - uses ovelapping metal blades, which can vary aperture
- The focal plane shutter - uses two curtains to control exposure. The first curtain exposes the sensor and the second fires after to cover the film or sensor.

the last 2 are manual or mechanical shutters.
