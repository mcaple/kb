#### ISO and metering

Exposure is the amount of light reaching the sensor. 

- ISO is a numerical expression of the digital sensor's sensitivity
- The lower the number the less sensitive to light and less noise your camera produces
- Higher ISO settings are generally used in darker situations to get faster shutter speeds, however the result is noisier images 

Generally use the lowest ISO possible.

**Everytime the ISO is doubled we double the amount of light**

EACH ELEMENT OF THE EXPOSURE TRIANGLE HAS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY OF MANIPULATING LIGHT, AND THEREBY THE QUALITY OF THE EXPOSURE: 

-  APERTURE 
- SHUTTER SPEED 
- ISO 

IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE THREE ELEMENTS WORK TOGETHER TO GENERATE AN EXPOSURE VALUE (EV). THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS MANIPULATE ONE SETTING WITHOUT HAVING A DIRECT IMPACT ON ONE OR BOTH OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE EXPOSURE TRIANGLE.

LET’S SAY THAT WE SET OUR EXPOSURE TRIANGLE TO THE FOLLOWING SETTINGS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A CORRECT EXPOSURE FOR A CERTAIN SCENE: F/8, 1/2000TH, AND ISO 200. HOWEVER, SINCE WE’RE PHOTOGRAPHING A FLYING BIRD AND WE’D LIKE TO FREEZE THE MOTION, THAT MEANS WE NEED TO INCREASE OUR SHUTTER SPEED. TO CORRECT IT, WE MUST INCREASE THE SHUTTER SPEED FROM 1/2000TH TO 1/4000TH (1 STOP DIFFERENCE) IF WE DON’T COMPENSATE ON THE REST OF THE EXPOSURE TRIANGLE, OUR EXPOSURE VALUE WILL CHANGE AND THE IMAGE WILL NO LONGER BE CORRECTLY EXPOSED, IT WILL BE UNDEREXPOSED BECAUSE WE ARE NOW LETTING LESS LIGHT IN.

SO TO COMPENSATE, WE’LL NEED TO CHANGE OUR APERTURE BY 1 STOP FROM F/8 TO F/5.6 OR WE CAN INCREASE AN ISO BY 1 STOP FROM ISO 200 TO 400 THE LOGIC IS SIMPLE: IF WE’RE CAPTURING LESS LIGHT USING A FASTER SHUTTER SPEED, WE NEED TO EITHER USE A WIDER APERTURE TO LET MORE LIGHT INTO THE CAMERA OR INCREASE THE ISO FOR GREATER LIGHT SENSIVITY. THIS ALLOWS US TO COMPENSATE ON THE EXPOSURE TRIANGLE FOR A CORRECT EXPOSURE.

#### Light metering

A cemera's light meter will measure reflacted light of a subject whereas and incident measure shows the light falling on the subject.

CAMERA METERS MEASURE REFLECTED LIGHT AND THIS PRESENTS A PROBLEM. DIFFERENT SUBJECTS REFLECT DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF LIGHT AND THE CAMERA WILL SET AN EXPOSURE ACCORDINGLY. CAMERA MANUFACTURERS CALIBRATE METERS BASED ON THE LUMINANCE (AMOUNT) OF LIGHT REFLECTED BY A MID-TONED GREY OBJECT, ALSO KNOWN AS 18% GREY. THIS VARIES BETWEEN MANUFACTURERS, BUT USUALLY RANGES BETWEEN 13% AND 18%. THE AVERAGE REFLECTANCE OF EVERYDAY SCENES IS ROUGHLY MID-GREY, HOWEVER BRIGHT SCENES AND DARK SCENES WILL USUALLY SET EXPOSURE SETTINGS THAT DELIVER INCORRECT EXPOSURE. FOR EXAMPLE, A SNOW SCENE WILL BE TOO DARK AS THE METER WILL SET AN EXPOSURE TO ACHIEVE A MID-TONE GREY. AN INCIDENT METER WILL SET EXPOSURE SETTINGS IRRESPECTIVE OF SUBJECT REFLECTANCE.

Camera metering modes maybe

- Spot metering - can meter in a specific part of the image, this metering can give skewed results if you want exposure for the whole image rather than a subject/object.
- Centre-weighted metering - meter around the centre of the scene, usually around 60-80% of the scene, regardless of focal point.
- Matrix/evaluative metering - you meter from multiple spots on the image and then produce an average reading overall. Most common metering in cameras.
