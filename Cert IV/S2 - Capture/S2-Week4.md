#### ISO and metering

Exposure is the amount of light reaching the sensor. 

- ISO is a numerical expression of the digital sensor's sensitivity
- The lower the number the less sensitive to light and less noise your camera produces
- Higher ISO settings are generally used in darker situations to get faster shutter speeds, however the result is noisier images 

Generally use the lowest ISO possible.

**Everytime the ISO is doubled we double the amount of light**
