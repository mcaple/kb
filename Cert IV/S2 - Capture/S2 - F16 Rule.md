**Sun behind us**

For example if your ISO is 400 and the sun is behind you then you could

f16 @ 1/400      with an ISO of 400
f11 @ 1/800      with an ISO of 400
f8 @ 1/1600      with an ISO of 400

we could adjust by

f11 @ 1/400      with an ISO of 200
f8 @ 1/400      with an ISO of 100
f5.6 @ 1/800      with an ISO of 50


If the sun is infront then you can stop down +2, +3
