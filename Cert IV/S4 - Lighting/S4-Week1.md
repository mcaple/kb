Visible light travels in waves and straight line from a source.

The sun changes direction throughout the day and also changes colour temperature. Point light sources such as the sun creates **hard** shadows.

Colour of light measure in degrees Kelvin. In photography our white point as daylight is refernced at 5500k but all light has a colour temperature.

We control the light hitting the camera using 

- Aperture
- ISO  more ISO === more noise/graininess
- Shutter speed.

According to Langford, there are five characteristics of lighting to bear in mind:

- Quality - hard/soft
- Direction
- Contrast
- Evenness
- Colour + intesity

Remember visible light is only a small portion of the light spectrum

- Light for imaging is created by combining Red, Green and Blue colours
- When all colours are fully represented in equal proportions we create White light
- As we reduce this value or intensity of each colour proportionally we create Grey
- Eventually when no colours are present, Black
