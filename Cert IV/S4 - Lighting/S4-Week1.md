Visible light travels in waves and straight line from a source.

The sun changes direction throughout the day and also changes colour temperature. Point light sources such as the sun creates **hard** shadows.

Colour of light measure in degrees Kelvin. In photography our white point as daylight is refernced at 5500k but all light has a colour temperature.

We control the light hitting the camera using 

- Aperture
- ISO  more ISO === more noise/graininess
- Shutter speed.

According to Langford, there are five characteristics of lighting to bear in mind:

- Quality - hard/soft
- Direction
- Contrast
- Evenness
- Colour + intesity

Remember visible light is only a small portion of the light spectrum

- Light for imaging is created by combining Red, Green and Blue colours
- When all colours are fully represented in equal proportions we create White light
- As we reduce this value or intensity of each colour proportionally we create Grey
- Eventually when no colours are present, Black

As we increase or decrease the 3 colours proportionally we create **tone**.

If one colour is more prominant than the others then we have a colour cast
In this instance we have more blue than red/green

Colour temperature changes throughout the day and is also seasonal.
Colour temperature can also assist to depict mood.

Light waves are not uni-directional

The wavelength of light can be thought of as the distance between two peaks/troughs. We see different wavelengths as different colours.
Frequency is the number of cycles per second, measured in Hertz.

Colour is determined by wavelenth/frequency.

For photographic purposes the visible spectrum can be thought of as three wavebands consisting of:

- 400 to 500 nm as blue/violet
- 500 to 600 nm as green
- 600 to 700 nm as red

**The human eye is most sensitive to 500nm to 600nm Green -Yellow**

Wavelength equates to colour and amplitude as intensity.

A coloured opaque object selectively absorbs particular wavelengths of light and reflects others. For instance if red and blue wavelengths are absorbed we see that object as green. A red dot appears to be red because blue and green wavelengths are being selectively absorbed.

Similarly, a coloured transparent object (filter) selectively absorbs particular wavelengths. A Yellow filter absorbs Magenta and Yellow (Red) wavelengths and transmits Blue and Green (Cyan) wavelengths.

A Cyan filter absorbs Magenta and Yellow (Red) wavelengths and transmits Blue and Green (Cyan) wavelengths.

A Magenta filter absorbs Cyan and Yellow (Green) wavelengths and transmits Red and Blue (Magenta) wavelengths.
