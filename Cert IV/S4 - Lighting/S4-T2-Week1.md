Get ready for portrait template for next week

Maybe 4 different poses on one person
or 4 different techniques for each one

Most important, what is the message.

For example, bright colours for kids


Split light, bring light slightlty forward of the face.

Butterly-beauty light should not be too high to produce socket shadow or too low then you do not get the cheek contours.

Light sources should probably be a bit larger to give a softer outcome.

We want good contrast and sharp

Dark clothing with slight people makes them slighter

Potraits, use mid or long length lens (50-70 mm)

Spill, bring the light or camera closer?

If the back meter reading and the camera are the same then the background will be white
If I go down a stop on the background light then the background goes greyer
Another stop will become darker.
