Colour and design teaches "colour theory, design principles and design processes and how to integrate these into your photography practice to effectively communicate ideas. You will undertake a series of tasks, allowing you to experiment, refine your techniques and review your progress"

### Elements of design

The term design can be defined in many different ways, depending on the context. So what do we mean when we refer to design in this presentation? 

One specific definition is closely related to the term composition, which means ’putting together’.

Design: “the arrangement of elements or details.” (Merriam-Webster Dictionary) 
Composition: “the way in which its various parts are put together and arranged.” (Collins Dictionary) 

When referring to the way the photographer arranges (or puts together) the visual elements within a photograph, we can use either the term design or composition. You will probably hear us use both terms frequently!

Design/composition is made up of **visual order**, **structure**, **arrangement**, **placement**, **organisation**, **layout**.

#### Elements and principles of design

Elements: fundamental components/ characteristics
	-  Line     (collection of similar objects, series of widely spaced points, by edges or tonal areas, direction of objects) They can suggest perspective and guide viewers eye. 
	- Shape  (made of lines joined in particular way or lines around an edge)  Regular or irregular.
	- Form (shape is 2d, form 3d) e.g sphere, cube, pyramid, cone, cylinder
	- Volume (form jumps out of page, volume into the page)
	- Texture (primary quality of a surface, perceived by eyes as well as sense of touch, often dependent on distant/size/magnification) Wet, glossy or smooth surfaces reflect light. Rough surfaces absorb light, cross lighting reveal texture. Natural: stone, wood, skin, earth. Man-made: metallic, tooled-textures (i.e brick) etc
	- Tone (lightness or darkness of an object, also known as value). Can be used to suggest depth and distance, create mood, create contrast and focus attention, create illusion of form and dimension. In real life tone is created by the way light falls on an object, the brightest areas are called highlights, the darker areas shadows. The area of highest contrast always demands attention.
	- Colour (Colour is what we perceive when light waves strike an object and reflect back into the optic nerve in the human eye). Colour has the attributes: Hue – a pure or true colour,  Value (or tone) – brightness of hue, Saturation – intensity of hue.

Principles: rules or guidelines that help us bring order to our design
	- Unity *"the primary pricnciple of design"*
	- Dominance
	- Contrast
	- Rhythm regular repeating occurence of elements in a scene. Can be regular or irregular. Can be random, regular, alternating, flowing and progressive. Rhythm creates interest, movement, harmony/unity. 
	- Balance  the relationship between opposing elements. Gives a sense of harmony. Relationship between lines and points and objects, where forces equally opposed find harmony and symmetry. If balanced the image has equlibrium. A lack of balance introduces visual tension. The two forms of balance are *formal* (centered arrangement, subject appears in the middle, can appear static. Includes properties such as dignity, formality, discipline, severity, regulation) and *informal* (opposite of formal, opposing objects appear unequal, balance of one or more units by dissimilar or contrasting units, on opposite sides of an axis. Balance achieved through mutual opposition such as a large object with a small one. Unbalanced images can create tension.)

Elements and principles form the plans of **visual order**
