#### Introduction to colour

In this session, you will be introduced to Colour Theory.Â Understanding how to effectively use colour in your photographic practice is an essential skill. You will learn how to create custom colour schemes during the in-class activity, investigating cool and warm colour relationships and colour discord.

White light can be split into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet as discovered by Isaac Newton in the 1660s.

Colour is a brain interpretation of various wavelengths (colours(hue) of light).
There are 7 spectral hues.

Properties of colour:
 - Hue (spectral purity, colour)
 - Saturation (colourfulness, intensity of hue or saturation point)
 - Brightness luminance level of sources and objects (CIE)

Saturation increase as brightness increases.

The Munsell colour order is based on a 3D model of hue (colour, such as red, orange etc), value (lightness or darkness of colour), chroma (saturation of colour)
