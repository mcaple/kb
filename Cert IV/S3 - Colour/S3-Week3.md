#### Introduction to colour

In this session, you will be introduced to Colour Theory. Understanding how to effectively use colour in your photographic practice is an essential skill. You will learn how to create custom colour schemes during the in-class activity, investigating cool and warm colour relationships and colour discord.

White light can be split into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet as discovered by Isaac Newton in the 1660s.

Colour is a brain interpretation of various wavelengths (colours(hue) of light).
There are 7 spectral hues.

Properties of colour:
 - Hue (spectral purity, colour)
 - Saturation (colourfulness, intensity of hue or saturation point)
 - Brightness luminance level of sources and objects (CIE)

Saturation increase as brightness increases.

The Munsell colour order is based on a 3D model of hue (colour, such as red, orange etc), value (lightness or darkness of colour), chroma (saturation of colour)  

Colour schemes:
- Monochromatic vary value and saturation only
- Analagous uses colour next to each other on the colour wheel, such as reds and oranges or cooler colours like blues and greens.
- Complementary are opposite each other on the wheel.

- Split Complementary uses colours on either side of the complement. Gives same level of contrast as complementary but more colours to work with.![[../../Attachments/Pasted image 20230311150602.png]]
- Triadic colour scheme uses 3 colurs that are evenly spaced. Forming perfect triangle on the wheel. Tend to be striking, especially with primary or secondary colours.![[../../Attachments/Pasted image 20230311150842.png]]
- Tetradic colur schemes form a pattren that is rectangular on the wheel, using two complementary colour scheme. Works best if you let one colour dominate and use the others as an accent. ![[../../Attachments/Pasted image 20230311151212.png]]

There are a number of do's and don'ts in colour schemes. If two colours clash with each each other then you can tone them down. This can be done by choosing one colour and adjust it's lightness, darkness or saturation.

Readability is vitally important, colours should be legible and easy on the eyes. Sometimes this means don't use too much colour. Neutral colours like white, black and gray can help balance design.

Bright colours tend to have a fun or modern vibe, desaturated colours appear more business like.

A colour wheel is an illustrative organization of colours around a circle, showing the relationships between primary colours, secondary colours, and tertiary colours.

The 3 colour wheels are:

- The Traditional Colour Wheel – used when mixing paint![[../../Attachments/Pasted image 20230311162345.png]]
- The RGB Colour Wheel – used when creating colour from light. Additive model, energy based model. ![[../../Attachments/Pasted image 20230311162536.png]]
This additive model would lead to

- The CMYK Colour Wheel (Cyan, Yellow, Magenta, Key (black)) - pigment  based model, used when creating colour for printing and ink. Rather than starting in a black/no light world we are starting on a pure white paper world and so we need to subtract.![[../../Attachments/Pasted image 20230311162617.png]]
This subtractive idea would lead to

Primary colours are the main colours in a given colour system and cannot be produced by mixing other colours in the system.

Secondary colours are produced by mixing two primary colours.

#### Note that mixing the primary colours of CMY produces the primary colours of light (RGB).


Tertiary colours are made by mixing one Primary and one Secondary colour the colour wheel.

Tertiary colours of the RGB and CMYK colour wheels are created by adding one Primary and one Secondary colour together. Remember that the RGB and CMYK colour wheels are inversions of each other!

### Colour schemes (already covered above, mostly)

- Monochromatic colours: variations in lightness and saturation of a single colour/hue. -
-  Analogous colours: three colours which are side by side on the colour wheel. 
- Complementary colours: any two colours which are directly opposite each other. 
- Triad colours: Three hues equal distance from each other. 
- Split Complementary or compound colours: two close hues opposite to another hue. 
- Tetrad colours: a combination of two sets of complementary colours found by rotating around the colour wheel sixty degrees from each other. 
- Cool/Warm colours: referring to temperature, warm: reds, yellows, oranges and cool greens, blues, purples. Team a warm with a cool colour for good contrast. 
- Colour discord: pairing two different colours that conflict each other. 
- Tints and shades: rather than using the full-strength hue of colours, lighter or darker versions can be created by adding white (tints) and adding black or grey (shades).


### Shade, tint and tone

- Shade - created by adding black to a base hue, darkening the colour. This creates a deeper, richer colour. Shades can be quite dramatic and can be overpowering. 
- Tint - created by adding white to a base hue, lightening the colour. This can make a colour less intense, and is useful when balancing more vivid colour combinations. 
- Tone - created by combining black and white—or grey—with a base hue. Like tints, tones are subtler versions of the original colour. Tones are less likely to look pastel, and can reveal complexities not apparent in the base colour.
