#### Introduction to colour

In this session, you will be introduced to Colour Theory. Understanding how to effectively use colour in your photographic practice is an essential skill. You will learn how to create custom colour schemes during the in-class activity, investigating cool and warm colour relationships and colour discord.

White light can be split into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet as discovered by Isaac Newton in the 1660s.

Colour is a brain interpretation of various wavelengths (colours(hue) of light).
There are 7 spectral hues.

Properties of colour:
 - Hue (spectral purity, colour)
 - Saturation (colourfulness, intensity of hue or saturation point)
 - Brightness luminance level of sources and objects (CIE)

Saturation increase as brightness increases.

The Munsell colour order is based on a 3D model of hue (colour, such as red, orange etc), value (lightness or darkness of colour), chroma (saturation of colour)  

Colour schemes:
- Monochromatic vary value and saturation only
- Analagous uses colour next to each other on the colour wheel, such as reds and oranges or cooler colours like blues and greens.
- Complementary are opposite each other on the wheel.

- Split Complementary uses colours on either side of the complement. Gives same level of contrast as complementary but more colours to work with.![[../../Attachments/Pasted image 20230311150602.png]]
- Triadic colour scheme uses 3 colurs that are evenly spaced. Forming perfect triangle on the wheel. Tend to be striking, especially with primary or secondary colours.![[../../Attachments/Pasted image 20230311150842.png]]
- Tetradic colur schemes form a pattren that is rectangular on the wheel, using two complementary colour scheme. Works best if you let one colour dominate and use the others as an accent. ![[../../Attachments/Pasted image 20230311151212.png]]

There are a number of do's and don'ts in colour schemes. If two colours clash with each each other then you can tone them down. This can be done by choosing one colour and adjust it's lightness, darkness or saturation.

Readability is vitally important, colours should be legible and easy on the eyes. Sometimes this means don't use too much colour. Neutral colours like white, black and gray can help balance design.

Bright colours tend to have a fun or modern vibe, desaturated colours appear more business like.
