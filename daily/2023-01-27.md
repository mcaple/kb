Attended a teams meeting on the content for the Cert IV photography course. Signed up for Orientation day on Monday 6th February and also completed my timetable for the course. Need to see if possible to swap duting orientation.

Cloned student laptop to new laptop.

Realised that Clonezilla needs to use expert mode and use the -r option along with allowing a scan of the disk before copy.

Will purchase a 1TB/2TB M.2 SSD card for the new laptop and clone once again.
