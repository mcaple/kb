When you half click a the button the camera will do a number of things including

- focusing
- performing a light meter reading

Current cameras have something called a TTL meter (through the lens meter). In the past people had to lug light meters around.

The camera will measure the light and will then calculate a shutter speed and aperture combination that it thinks will yield the best result i.e good exposure.

On my camera the shutter speed and aperture reading appear in the bottom left of the screen.
