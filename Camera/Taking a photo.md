When you half click a the button the camera will do a number of things including

- focusing
- performing a light meter reading

Current cameras have something called a TTL meter (through the lens meter). In the past people had to lug light meters around.

The camera will measure the light and will then calculate a shutter speed and aperture combination that it thinks will yield the best result i.e good exposure.

On my camera the shutter speed and aperture reading appear in the bottom left of the screen.

### The exposure triangle and reciprocity

We saw that typically any shutter speed slower than 1/64 will cause a blurry picture if we try to hand hold the camera. 

To get around this we need to get more light to the sensor so that our shutter speed can increase. This is where aperture and ISO come into it. We can:

- open up the aperture to get more light into the sensor and that will increase the shutter speed.
- increase ISO so that camera becomes more sensitive so we can get away with faster shutter speed.


The human eye has around 18-20 stops of dynamic range whe looking at what's around us. A camera typically has between 12-14 stops of dynamic range (maximum span of light that can be seen is any one situation). This is why the eye can see for instance someone standing infront of a window when there is a lot of light behind them but the camera sees the person is big shadows.

Cameras sometimes have an auto exposure bracketing function so that they take a photo at maybe 3 different exposures so that post production you can decide which works. You can see how this is done [here](https://photofocus.com/photography/setting-up-bracketing-on-sony-cameras/)

**Most things reflect around 18% of light that hits them regradless of its makeup. This is the reason that metering is metering for a mid grey as it assumes that the object being photographed is reflecting 18% of the light.
