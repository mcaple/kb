The shutter maybe a curtain based mechanical one where it is actually two curtains. As one is opening another is closing that gives very fast exposure times. Another may simply be an electronic shutter where light is simply allowed in or not through circuitry such as on a phone.

Typical shutter speeds are:

1/15, 1/30, 1/60, 1/125, 1/250, 1/500, 1/1000, 1/2000, 1/4000

Remember the f-stop indicates a doubling/halving of light as we go up and down. This is because we will double/halve the time the shutter speed is open.
