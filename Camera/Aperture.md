The aperture is on the lens whereas the shutter is on the camera body. It is an iris of interlocking metal blades.

### F-stop

Refers to the size of the hole on your aperture. The higher the number the smaller the hole. Think of this as the F-stop referring to the size of the blades on the aperture. The higher the number the more of the blades you can see.

Typical F-stops are:

- f2/.8
- f/4
- f/5.6
- f/8
- f/11
- f/16
- f/22

The f-stop is a ratio between the lens length to size of aperture and hence why it is not a clean increment but rest assured there is an opening twice/half as big as the previous/successive number. The hole halves as we go down the list and doubles as we go up.
