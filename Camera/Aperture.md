The aperture is on the lens whereas the shutter is on the camera body. It is an iris of interlocking metal blades.

### F-stop

Refers to the size of the hole on your aperture. The higher the number the smaller the hole. Think of this as the F-stop referring to the size of the blades on the aperture. The higher the number the more of the blades you can see.

Typical F-stops are:

- f/1
- f/1.4
- f/2
- f2/.8
- f/4
- f/5.6
- f/8
- f/11
- f/16
- f/22

The f-stop is a ratio between the lens length to size of aperture and hence why it is not a clean increment but rest assured there is an opening twice/half as big as the previous/successive number. The hole halves as we go down the list and doubles as we go up.

When your camera is able to use a custom button we may have the following exposure equivalent options:

| Shutter Speed | Aperture Size |
| ------------- | -------- |
| 60            | f/2.5    |
| 45            | f/2.8    |
| 125           | f/1.8    |
| 180           | f/1.4         |

If we change the aperture from 2.8 to 2.5 that is a third of a stop (.3). Also going from 1/60 to 1/45 of a second is also a third in terms of shutter speed.

We cannot go higher than f/1.4 because that is as high as the particular lens will go.

The following changes for the lens you are using, distance from the subject etc

f/1 gives a razor thin depth of field, you are focusing in on just the eyes for example. This idea is called boka (Japanese)
f/1.4, f/2 draw attention to the face for example or a flower
f/4, 5/5.6 tend to be somewhere in the middle so not used frequently, not giving that depth of separation nor that extreme focus. You can isolate the subject but gives the viewer an idea of what's going on in the background.
f/8 group photographs for example to include everyone
f/11, f/16 portrait photography or image with a lot of detail. Image becomes sharp, landscape, street photography. Almost 2D feel to the photograph
f/22 and beyond huge depth of field, laser beam of light so image really sharp. Allows the eye to wander as everything in focus. Epic landscapes, internal churches etc

Lots of cameras have a depth of field preview button to give an idea of how the image would look.

**The following is a bit confusing**

Potraits generally want the softest, bluriest background so you want very little DOF, large aperture hole.
Landscape you want big DOF, small aperture hole

**This is an easier way of looking at it** ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=EdxKl5np9KE))

Just stick with f numbers

Small f number is a small DOF
Larg f number is a large DOF

You could also imagine a whole lot of "f's" going off from the camera into the distance so the less "f's" the less is in focus.

*Basically the more things you want in focus the more "f's" you want.*

By using a small f-stop you can make your subject sharp so you could photograph through a wire fence at a zoo onto the animal or a lions head that was surrounded by grass.

So the question before taking a photograph should be
- Where do we want the viewers eye to go, everywhere, on the thing or somewhere in between?
- If one subject then small f number for small DOF
- Multiple things, big f number

Generally around 2/3rds of focus is behind the subject and 1/3 in front. This is very important for instance if you are taking a landscape photo. Most people focus on the distant mountains but that means 2/3rds behind the mountain is in focus and your stuff close is out of focus, like the rocks and pebbles near you. Instead focus around 1/3rd ahead of you. 

Large DOF can make any light source turn into a "light burst". To get the effect for example, half press when sun behind a cloud then move slightly until sun is bleeding over over cloud and take photo.
