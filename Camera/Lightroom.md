A good way of organising within Lightroom is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmTr5V-DBoE)

#### Collections
These are a Lightroom way of grouping photos. They can be from many different folders.

You simply need to go to the left "Collections" panel and hit the "+" sign.

After naming a collection, you can simply drag and drop your photos into that collection


**Shortcuts**
- V - convert to black and white
- T - toggle tab bar below the photo
- P - pick photo
- X - reject photo
- 0-5 - star the image
- 6-9 - colour the image (same number again to take off colour)

You can organise by location. This is contained in the metadata expandable panel. When you look at it you can type city, province etc
