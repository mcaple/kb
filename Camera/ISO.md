Shutter speed and aperture are physical items that controls the amount of light that hits the sensors on the focal plane.

ISO is your cameras sensitity to light. Camera film used to have varying ISO values.

You can increase your cameras ISO which allows more light to obtain a brighter image. Unfortunately this will also amplify any stray noise on the image. You may see blotches on your image.

In film days as you increased ISO the pictures became grainier.

### Keep your ISO as low as possible
