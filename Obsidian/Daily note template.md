My chosen daily note template is based on work from

- [Dann Berg](https://dannb.org/blog/2022/obsidian-daily-note-template/)
- [Michael Bryxi](https://dev.to/michalbryxi/structured-dailyweekly-notes-in-obsidian-2n5h)

I have also created a Scratchpad Templates folder that uses the idea from [this](https://facedragons.com/productivity/obsidian-templates-with-examples/)
